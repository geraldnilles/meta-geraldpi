This layer is for creating the various linux appliances throughout my house


I. Adding the meta-geraldpi layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-geraldpi'


II. Edit the build/conf/local.conf file
=======================================

Set the Machine to raspberry pi::

	MACHINE ??= "raspberrypi4-64"

Set the distro to "gpoky"::

	DISTRO ?= "gpoky"


Set the defautl timezone::

	DEFAULT_TIMEZONE = "America/Los_Angeles"


Set the Wifi credentials:: 

	WIFI_SSID = "IoTSubNetwork"
	WIFI_PASSWORD = "My password"

Increase the number of threads to speed up the build process::

	BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "8"
	PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 4"


III. Prepare a USB Drive
========================

In most of my images, the persistant storage is pulled off the sd card and put
into an external USB drive. This allow one to upgrade th OS and swap out an SD
card without losing all of the existing data. Anecdotally, i have also found
that the SD card is less reliable than the USB flash drive. This architecture
leans into that thesis.  At some point in the future, i may also switch the
rootfs into a read-only filesystem. This would further minimize writes to the
SD card and improve reliability

Host scripts are provided in the recipes-geraldpi/images/host_scripts/ folder
for preparing the USB drive. THese scripts can be run on the host machine to
prepare the USB flash drive for mounting


IV. Build one of the images
============================



V. TODOs
=========

[ ] Only enable Wifi for devices i plan on using wifi for... perhaps add a switch in the "image" recipe to delete the wpa_supplicant file?
[ ] Todo Flask App
