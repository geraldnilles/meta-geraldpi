# Write the current mode into a /tmp file.  If the entire house temp exceeds
# the MIN threshold, then switch to heat.  If the entire house temp exceeds
# MAX, then switch to Cool.  
#
# My reasoning is becasue a particular temp sensor might be placed close to a
# vent and have a large swing.  I dont want to wildly toggle between heating
# and cooling

# TODO Add logic for turning on the Fan if the temp differential between rooms is > 5 degrees
# 	If Temp Diff > 5 dgrees and Fan is off,
# 		Turn on fan exit
